            Welcome to Vouchiqo. By accessing or using our platform, website, and services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. Please read them carefully.

            <p>
              Vouchiqo provides a directory of verified discount vouchers, promotional codes, and merchant integration portals. You agree to use the service only for lawful, personal, non-commercial purposes unless explicitly approved by merchant agreements.

            <p>
              To access certain features (such as tracking claims, analytics, or posting coupons), you must create a secure account. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and Better Auth OTP tokens.

            <p>
              Merchant partners agree to honor active, verified campaigns posted on their public profiles. Vouchiqo reserves the right to evict campaigns or restrict accounts displaying high rates of broken checkouts or invalid redemption responses.

            <p>
              Vouchiqo provides its services "as is" and "as available". We do not guarantee that every coupon will yield discounts at merchant checkouts due to changing third-party terms, though our verification systems work in real-time to maximize accuracy.

              To the maximum extent permitted by law, Vouchiqo Corp. shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of your access to or use of the services.
